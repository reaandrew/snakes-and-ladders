# Checkov configuration for snakes-and-ladders
# Skip checks that are excessive for a simple game application

skip-check:
  # Lambda VPC - not needed for simple game, adds complexity and cost
  - CKV_AWS_117 # Lambda function configured inside VPC

  # Lambda DLQ - game actions are real-time, DLQ doesn't make sense
  - CKV_AWS_116 # Lambda configured for Dead Letter Queue

  # Lambda code signing - overkill for a game, we have CI/CD controls
  - CKV_AWS_272 # Lambda code-signing validation

  # Lambda reserved concurrency - let AWS manage scaling
  - CKV_AWS_115 # Lambda concurrent execution limit

  # Lambda env var encryption - table name is not sensitive
  - CKV_AWS_173 # Lambda environmental variable encryption

  # CloudWatch log retention 1 year - 14 days is sufficient for game logs
  - CKV_AWS_338 # CloudWatch logs retain for 1 year

  # CloudWatch log KMS encryption - game logs are not sensitive
  - CKV_AWS_158 # CloudWatch Log Group encrypted by KMS

  # S3 lifecycle abort incomplete uploads - not critical for frontend assets
  - CKV_AWS_300 # S3 lifecycle abort failed uploads

  # GitHub Actions IAM - needs broad permissions for CI/CD deployment
  - CKV_AWS_289 # IAM permissions management constraints (aws_setup)
  - CKV_AWS_290 # IAM write access constraints (aws_setup)
  - CKV_AWS_355 # IAM wildcard resources (aws_setup)

  # API Gateway logging - not critical for game
  - CKV_AWS_76 # API Gateway access logging
  - CKV2_AWS_29 # API Gateway access logging enabled

  # WAF additional rules - basic rate limiting is sufficient
  - CKV2_AWS_47 # WAF has rules configured

  # S3 versioning for logs bucket - logs are temporary
  - CKV_AWS_21 # S3 versioning enabled (logs bucket)

  # S3 MFA delete - overkill for game assets
  - CKV_AWS_54 # S3 MFA delete

  # Cross-region replication - single region is fine for a game
  - CKV_AWS_144 # S3 cross-region replication

  # API Gateway caching - real-time game doesn't need caching
  - CKV_AWS_225 # API Gateway caching enabled

  # EventBridge bus encryption - no eventbridge used
  - CKV_AWS_343 # EventBridge custom bus encrypted
