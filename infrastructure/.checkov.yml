# Checkov configuration for snakes-and-ladders
# Only skip checks that are genuinely impractical for this application

skip-check:
  # Lambda VPC - adds NAT gateway cost (~$30/month) and complexity
  - CKV_AWS_117 # Lambda function configured inside VPC

  # Lambda DLQ - real-time game, async retry doesn't make sense
  - CKV_AWS_116 # Lambda configured for Dead Letter Queue

  # Lambda code signing - requires certificate setup, overkill for a game
  - CKV_AWS_272 # Lambda code-signing validation

  # CloudWatch log retention 1 year - 14 days is sufficient, cost savings
  - CKV_AWS_338 # CloudWatch logs retain for 1 year

  # GitHub Actions IAM - deploy role needs broad permissions by design
  - CKV_AWS_289 # IAM permissions management constraints (aws_setup)
  - CKV_AWS_290 # IAM write access constraints (aws_setup)
  - CKV_AWS_355 # IAM wildcard resources (aws_setup)

  # S3 MFA delete - requires root account access
  - CKV_AWS_54 # S3 MFA delete

  # Cross-region replication - adds cost, overkill for a game
  - CKV_AWS_144 # S3 cross-region replication

  # API Gateway caching - breaks real-time game behavior
  - CKV_AWS_225 # API Gateway caching enabled

  # EventBridge bus encryption - we don't use EventBridge
  - CKV_AWS_343 # EventBridge custom bus encrypted
